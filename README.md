# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

In this project, I created a webpage that has functionality on desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers. We utilized HTML and CSS with Responsive Design.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
